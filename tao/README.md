# Blade DISC for TensorFlow

Blade-DISC is a dynamic shape compiler (DISC) for machine learning workload.
To make easier to use Blade-DISC for TensorFlow users, we build this TensorFlow
wrapper Python package. A quick and easy example to enable Blade-DISC is as the following:

``` python
import blade_disc_tf
blade_disc_tf.enable()
```
